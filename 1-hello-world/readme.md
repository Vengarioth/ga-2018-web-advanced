# Hello World

This folder has a standard es6 boilerplate to compile es6 down to a subset modern browsers fully support.

## Setup

First you need `nodejs` and `npm` (which comes with your default node installation). Go to https://nodejs.org/ and pick the latest build available for your operating system.

After that open a terminal in this folder and run `npm i` to install all nececary dependencies. Once completed you can run `npm start` to launch a dev server (it will open a new tab in your browser and refresh every time you change the source code) or `npm run build` to build a version of your site you can put online into the `dist` folder.
